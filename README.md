Lab 0 for CS100, Fall 2019

Hi, welcome to my website!
Here I have three pages: Home (index.html), Fun in nature (a.html) and Mountain love (b.html). I heavily employ Bootstrap in index.html while a.html and b.html are more CSS heavy. Within index.html I use two images: me!.jpg and blue mtns.jpg. I use lists in both a.html and b.html and employ a table in b.html. It is possible to visit every page on my site from every other page!
